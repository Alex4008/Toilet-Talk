# Toilet-Talk
This was a group project for my CSE 385 (Databases) class at Miami University in Spring 2019

A team of 5 of us built this website using ASP in Spring of 2019, as our final project for our databases class (CSE 385) at Miami University.

Below, you can see a screenshot from early on in development. This shows off how the UI looks on the website.
